My name is Jim Cramer. I'm a retired IT Solutions Architect. At present, I help out as a volunteer for the [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/) organisation, based in Amsterdam.

My programming experience dates back from 1978, professionally with Fortran on IBM 370 mainframe using punched cards and, as a hobby, having fun with a 6502-based single-board [SYM-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYM-1) computer, soon after replaced with an [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II) microcomputer using Assembly, Basic and Pascal.

Other languages that I have worked with throughout the years (either professionally or as a hobby) include IBM Rexx, C, C++, C#, Java, Objective-C and Swift.

At present my focus is on JavaScript and TypeScript, working with frameworks such as Node.js, React and Angular.

On this YouTube video you can see me working on my Synertek SYM-1 microcomputer back in 1978:
